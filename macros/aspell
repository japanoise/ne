# This example macro works with your system's aspell
# command to spell-check the selected block of text.
# The AtomicUndo commands at the beginning and end make
# it possible to undo/redo the entire operation in one
# go. Otherwise the Cut and Paste would each require
# their own undo/redo. Indentation is just for clarity;
# it doesn't affect operation.
